Here are a few examplese of how python can be used as a functional programming language.

The example include: function composotion (as far as python allows), higher order function that acceps function, higher oreder function that returns function, and function currying.

I especially had a lot of fun doing function currying. What I really like about my implemenation is that i can curry pretty much any function.
